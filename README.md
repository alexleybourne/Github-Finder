A Github finder made using React js and the Github API

Made in React and boostrapped from Create React App. 
Made to improve my knowledge on react and it's magic.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Then..

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
